<div class="article__teaser">

I have about 20 years of experience in web development. In the late '90s I fell in love with the WWW and went through all the stages: from frames, “killer web sites” with tons of nested tables, up to web standards, semantic HTML&nbsp&amp; CSS, and finally to the dynamic web of today with progressive web apps and single page applications. Working for the web allows me to be creative, to build things, to write, to teach, and to learn something new every day&mdash;and I'm still loving it.

## Professional Experience

Since September 2003, I have been working as a freelancer in Munich. As **web developer with a focus on the front-end,** I have been working on many web projects, sometimes as the one person for everything (concept, design, development), sometimes as part of a team, e. g. for High View (planet-tv.de & waidwerk.tv until 2016) and Nickl PR (nickl-pr.de until 2018).

Since 2009, I have been the **web developer for [Team-Andro.com](https://www.team-andro.com/),** the largest German-speaking online community for fitness and bodybuilding. Please find a more detailed overview of my latest work in the section “[Work](/work/)” of this web site.

Until 2016, I have also worked on **architectural projects**: planning, 3D visualisation and realisation of architectural projects, exhibitions and events, e.g. for BMW, Osram, HypoVereinsbank, Rolls Royce und Starbucks.

## Publication

I love CSS and became sort of an expert. In 2008, I co-authored a **German book on advanced CSS** (<span lang="de">[Fortgeschrittene CSS-Techniken](https://www.rheinwerk-verlag.de/fortgeschrittene-css-techniken_2511/)</span>) with Ingo Chao. It was very well received and it stayed number one for German CSS books at Amazon for years. We updated it in three editions until 2011. In our book we explain CSS principles that are not self explanatory, like float, clear and collapsing margins&nbsp;&mdash;still relevant knowledge for developers.

Previously, I was involved in the publication of articles on the special _pain in the neck_ of Internet Explorer: <span lang="de">[Über hasLayout](https://onhavinglayout.fwpf-webdesign.de/)</span>, the German translation of [On Having Layout](http://web.archive.org/web/20180402172026/http://www.satzansatz.de/cssd/onhavinglayout.html) and [Thoughts on IE hack management](https://onhavinglayout.fwpf-webdesign.de/hack_management/). Fortunately, this is history.

## Teaching

I love teaching and besides coaching collegues and fellow developers, I had the chance to lecture at the Rosenheim University on **Web Design with (X)HTML & CSS** and **Computer-Aided Architectural Design** (3D Modelling & Visualization).

## Education & Academic Background

The web wasn't even a thing when I started to find a profession I both love and can make a living of. I started studying **German Language & Literature** and **History**, but was missing to be creative and build stuff. I completed an apprenticeship as a carpenter in preparation for my studies of **Interior Architecture** at the Rosenheim University where I graduated with a diploma as <i lang="de">Diplom-Ingenieurin (FH).</i>

In the late '90s, I fell in love with the web and have kept **teaching myself web development,** and I even became an expert in CSS. Many lessons learned during my university times proved to be extremely valuable: design principles, working in iterations, self motivation, self organisation, working both on your own and in teams, giving and receiving regular feedback e.&#8239;t.&#8239;c.

## What else?

When I'm not glued to some keyboard or touch device, you can probably find me riding one of my beloved bicycles, or sticking my nose in an (e)book about anything related to web development or UX. And sometimes, I enjoy watching one of those shallow British crime series on TV&nbsp;&hellip;
