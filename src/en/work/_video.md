The [Team-Andro video platform](https://www.team-andro.com/tube/) is used both for videos produced by Team-Andro and videos uploaded by the users of the community.

In 2016 it was decided to replace the outdated video software (still including a flash-based video player) with custom made software and an HTML5 video player. 

* I advocated for and established the use of the **Symfony framework** with Doctrine&nbsp;&amp; Twig and developed **all the major parts** of the software in PHP.

* I developed **every part of the front-end** in HTML, CSS and JavaScript (with jQuery)â€”from concept to the tooling (SASS &amp; Grunt) up to nearly every single line of the code.

* Except for the parts of the layout that were designed in the before mentioned design competition (mainly header and footer areas), I **designed and build the User Interface** of the video platform.
