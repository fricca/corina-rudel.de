Over the years, I have built many web projects&mdash;both smaller online portfolios and also larger projects with content management systems. Since 2009 I have been involved in the **development of the [team andro web site](https://www.team-andro.com),** an online community for fitness &amp; bodybuilding. In the beginning, I have been responsible for the front-end development of parts of the website, later I have been working on **both the front-end and the back-end‚Å†** in all parts of the various applications. Everything was developed in close cooperation in a small team with permanent **peer code reviews.**

In the following, I would like to provide some details on the essential parts of my latest work, mainly for the Team-Andro platform.
