The Team-Andro platform consists of several applications, tied together with a single sign-on. The rather outdated layout should be redesigned in a modern but timeless fashion. In the process of the redesign I wanted to lay a maintainable, modular groundwork for the front-end code that could be used in all applications.

* I wrote the **briefing document** ([view as PDF](/files/TEAM-ANDRO-Redesign-99designs.pdf)) for the [design competition](https://99designs.de/web-design/contests/almost-flat-design-bodybuilding-fitness-website-needed-766868) at 99designs.com and played an essential part in the design decisions. The result was delivered as several photoshop files, covering some parts of the website. I used these as a starting point for the development and further design of the UI.

* I developed the **[style guide](https://www.team-andro.com/static/_styleguide/)** to be used as documentation both for the essential parts of the design and the modular building blocks of the front-end code. It is built as a <i>living style guide</i> from comments in the SCSS files and is permanently updated and revised in the development process.
