* For the [Team-Andro forum](https://www.team-andro.com/phpBB3/) running on phpBB3, I have developed several modifications, e.&#8239;g. sign in with Facebook, a custom subscription system and a “Log Wizard” for the online coaching programs.

* I integrated **web push notifications** into the Team-Andro plattform. Registered users can subscribe to several notifications, e.&#8239;g. for news on their forum subscriptions, on new videos, new articles etc. A custom **service worker** script (a PWA feature) and an extension of the phpBB notification system handle the push subscription for capable desktop and mobile browsers. The push notifications are sent via a **custom node.js-server** using the [web-push library](https://github.com/web-push-libs/web-push).

* I established **Git as version control system** for the development at Team-Andro. It is currently used with the branching model based on [Vincent Driessen](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/)'s work (Gitflow Workflow).
