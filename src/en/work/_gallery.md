The [Team-Andro gallery](https://www.team-andro.com/gallery/) is based on the <i>Coppermine Photo Gallery</i> and has seen several custom overhauls. Most of the images in the gallery are uploaded by reporters covering bodybuilding competitions, but also every user in the community can upload their images.

* In 2018, I have rewritten **large parts of the PHP codebase**, e.&#8239;g. the upload and edit sections and the user profiles.

* I have redesigned and rewritten **nearly the whole front-end and UI** based on the style guide. The touch-friendly fullscreen view of the images and the management area where images can be sorted and edited were the most challenging tasks.
