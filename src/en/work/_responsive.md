For several projects, I was responsible for the full realisation: conception, design and development. Sometimes a CMS was used, sometimes static HTML with CSS & JavaScript was enough.

Since responsive design became a thing, every project I have built has been responsive. Some older projects were switched after being online for several years, often with a very tight budget.
